**The SECOND P:** Many people with predisposing factors never get insomnia. However, when stressful life events occur, people with predisposing factors are more likely to get insomnia. The stressful life events are called precipitating factors, or things that often trigger insomnia. As you learned at the start of this Core, these can include major life events (e.g., illness, divorce), as well as less severe but more chronic daily hassles (e.g., work stress, family conflicts), or other important changes in life (e.g., birth of a child, menopause.)

Hover over each of the characters to find out their precipitating factors.
