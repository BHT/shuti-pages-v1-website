It's no surprise that sleep difficulties often start during a stressful time in life. It might be an event related to your job, relationships, finances, or health. When the stress goes away, most people go back to their normal sleep patterns. But others (perhaps those more likely to get insomnia) continue to have sleep difficulties. For these people, insomnia seems to take on a life of its own.
